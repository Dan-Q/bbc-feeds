    <h2>The Feeds</h2>
    <p>
      Choose the feed you want and subscribe using your RSS reader:
    </p>
    <ul>
      {{FEEDS}}
      <li><a class="secondary" href="https://aboutfeeds.com/">What are feeds?</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      <a class="secondary" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News</a> provides a variety of RSS feeds for subscribing to news content.
      But they're not great, so I've been working on improving them:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In 2019, sick of seeing sports news (that I didn't care about),
        <a class="secondary" href="https://danq.me/2019/05/14/bbc-news-without-the-sport/">I started filtering out sports</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2024, the feed started being polluted by non-news content (links to iPlayer and BBC Sounds content, and plugs
        for the app). So
        <a class="secondary" href="https://danq.me/2024/03/09/bbc-news-without-the-crap/">I came up with a filter for them too</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2025, a commenter asked if I could make an alternate version of the feed that <em>didn't</em> exclude the
        sports news, <a class="secondary" href="https://danq.me/2025/02/03/bbc-news-rss-improved/">so I arranged for that too</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, when somebody asked on Mastodon whether I could start filtering not only the UK edition but also the
        World edition of BBC News... I realised it was time to turn this into a proper project.
